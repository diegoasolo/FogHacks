Description=An example where a binary (1-bit) checkerboard pattern and its inverse are displayed by a DMD under the control of external input triggers. A single trigger rule specifies that when a Rising Edge is detected on External Trigger Input 1 the next DMD frame will start. A separate Arduino program is contained in examples/arduino/TriggerTester.ino which can be used to generate an external trigger signal to control the DMD (or any other external hardware signal can be connected to External Trigger Input 1 which transitions for low to high).
