Description=A simple example where a DMD displays a binary color (3-bit) test pattern at a configurable frame rate. The 3-bit color image is composed of separate red, green and blue images. The 3 bitplanes are displayed slowly in their individual colors before finally being displayed in 3-bit color by switching between them at speed.
